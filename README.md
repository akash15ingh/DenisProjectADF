This project simulates a real-world data engineering and analytics pipeline.
I worked with multiple datasets covering:

Sales data for 4 years (2022-2025)

Product Categories and Sub-categories

Product details

Sales Representatives

Geographical information

The goal was to ingest, clean, transform, and model the data into a single structured dataset for business analysis and visualization using Power BI.

üì¶ Datasets Used
Sales (Yearly split: 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)

Category

Sub-category

Product

Sales Representative

Geography

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Azure Blob Storage (for raw file storage)

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) (for Bronze/Silver/Gold layer architecture)

On-Premise MySQL Database (simulated)

Azure Data Factory (ADF) (for data movement, cleansing, surrogate key generation, transformations)

Azure SQL Database (for curated gold layer storage)

Power BI (for data visualization)

üîÑ Data Flow Process
Data Ingestion:

CSV, JSON, and Excel files from Blob Storage

Tables from On-Prem MySQL Database

All raw data staged into Bronze Layer of ADLS.

Data Cleansing and Transformation:

Using ADF Mapping Data Flows:

Generated Surrogate Keys (e.g., GeoID, ProductID)

Standardized formats (Dates, Text casing, etc.)

Removed duplicates

Derived new columns (e.g., Profit calculation)

Stored cleaned datasets into Silver Layer of ADLS.

Data Modeling:

Joined all datasets logically (Sales, Product, Rep, Geography) using surrogate keys.

Built a final single denormalized table ready for analysis.

Stored the final dataset into Gold Layer of ADLS and Azure SQL Database.

Data Visualization:

Connected Power BI to Azure SQL DB.

Created dashboards and analytical reports on Sales, Revenue, Profits, Regional Performance, and Sales Rep performance.

üìà Highlights
Implemented Bronze-Silver-Gold Lakehouse Architecture.

Solved real-world challenges like:

Missing keys

Surrogate key generation

Data type mismatches

Complex joins across datasets

Designed a reusable, scalable, production-like pipeline using Azure-native tools.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Automate ingestion with Event Triggers and Incremental Loads.

Add Data Quality Checks at Silver Layer.

Implement Delta Lake architecture for version control.

Optimize Power BI dashboards for real-time refresh.
